            organization about Cooperation Science, with the purpose of

            is based on game theory, genetics, neuroscience, linguistics and
            complex systems and is currently able to support organizations

            Joining my experience in <i>filming</i> and <i>science</i> I wrote
            and directed together with Giovanni Caloro a documentary, "Why Me",
            featuring Nobel Prize Elizabeth Blackburn, about how much human
            lives are pre-determined by our DNA. It's currently available in
            Italy, US, UK, AUS and NZ on

           I have been diagnosed in 2021 to be in the Autism spectrum, level 1
            "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome">Asperger</a
            >", although with no apparent disability and with high level of
            empathy. Another test I had told me in fact I am also a "high
            sensitive",
            <a href="https://hsperson.com/test/highly-sensitive-test">HSP-E</a>
            person. I was sixteen years old when I entered
            <a href="https://www.mensa.org/">Mensa</a>, now I am no longer member
            of the association. My "Jungian" personality is instead
            <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">ENFJ-ENFP-A</a>.
            <br /><br />
            No test can really tell us who we are. Nevetheless, they can give out
            some hints about ourselves. <br />

        As a film director, I co-founded with Giovanni Caloro
        <a href="http://amarenapictures.com">Amarena Pictures</a>, a video
        production company born as a service for our directions in 2010.

        <div class="base jj f">
          I co-founded with Ilario Tito and some other girls and guys
          <a href="http://cooperacy.org">Cooperacy</a>, a research organization
          about Cooperation Science, with the purpose of co-creating a social
          ecosystem based on proportional distribution of activities, profits
          and governance, something close to a "social liberism". <br />I
          support complex organizations coordination, analyse their level of
          cooperation, hold conferences and workshops about Cooperation
          Science.<br />

          I have been diagnosed in 2021 to be in the Autism spectrum, level 1
          "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome">Asperger</a
          >", although with no apparent disability and with high level of
          empathy. Another test I had told me in fact I am also a "high
          sensitive",
          <a href="https://hsperson.com/test/highly-sensitive-test">HSP-E</a>
          person. I was sixteen years old when I entered
          <a href="https://www.mensa.org/">Mensa</a>, now I am no longer member
          of the association. My "Jungian" personality is instead
          <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">ENFJ-ENFP-A</a>.
          <br /><br />
          No test can really tell us who we are. Nevetheless, they can give out
          some hints about ourselves. <br />
          Now that you have some strange hints about me, feel free to write me,
          you should be able to find my name in many social networks.

          day.<br /><br /><br />
